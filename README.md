I'm Spencer — welcome to the page!

### I like to be lazy, and will work incredibly hard to help other people be lazy, too.

- 🎨 Most of my projects are centered around data processing and visualization, with a bit of developer utility libraries mixed in for zest
- 🏛️ During the day, I work at **[@constituentvoice](https://github.com/constituentvoice)** building utilties that help citizens connect with their elected representatives
- ☕ In my off hours, I spend my time playing music, writing (at **[@chaoticgoodcomputing](https://github.com/chaoticgoodcomputing)**), and drinking a reprehensible amount of drip coffee.

### Published Notes

I try to make a habit of publishing interesting/helpful notes from my Obsidian vault. If you read one and want to chat more about it, [reach out!](https://blog.chaoticgood.computer/contact)
